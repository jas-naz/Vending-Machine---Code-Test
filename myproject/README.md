# Vending Machine [React + Vite]

This is a coding test I was asked to perform for an Amazon front-end job. I don't like coding with someone watching but I went ahead and started it. I only had 20 min so I didn't get too far.

However, I decided to go further with as I understood it better as I worked through it and read the instructions thouroughly.

**Test Instructions**:

- Create a vending machine application that takes in a
  list of items and a
  list of coins.
  The vending machine should
  allow the user to select an item and
  insert coins to pay for the item.
- The vending machine should
  return the item if the user has inserted enough money.
- If the user has not inserted enough money,
  the vending machine should return the coins that were inserted.
- The vending machine should also
  return the item and any remaining change if the user has inserted more money than the item costs.

**Install it**:

```
npm install
```

**Run it**:

```
npm run dev
```

**Preview it**:

```
npm run preview
```

**How to test it**:

```
npm run test
```
